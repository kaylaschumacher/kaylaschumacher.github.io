            <p>Hello, I am Kayla Schumacher. I grew up in the suburbs of Seattle, Washington. I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I am currently a Test Systems Engineer at an aerospace company. I have decided to make a career change and began the MIT xPro Full Stack Software Developer certification program since I found that programing interested me the most when using LabView and Matlab in my current role. I am very excited and I look forward to seeing where this will take me.

        The Mr. Pacman project was designed to simulate the arcade game. In this version, Mr. Pacman is animated using four images. This creates the affect of Mr. Pacman chomping from one side of the screen and back endlessly.
